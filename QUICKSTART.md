# Quick Start Guide

Get up and running with LFM in 5 minutes!

## Prerequisites

- ✅ LFM installed → [Installation Guide](INSTALL.md)
- ✅ Last.fm account with scrobbling enabled

---

## Step 1: Get Your Last.fm API Key

LFM needs an API key to access your Last.fm data.

1. **Visit the Last.fm API page:**
   - Go to https://www.last.fm/api/account/create
   - Log in to your Last.fm account if prompted

2. **Create an application:**
   - **Application name**: `LFM CLI` (or any name you like)
   - **Application description**: `Personal Last.fm statistics tool`
   - Check the box: "I have read and agree to the API Terms of Service"
   - Click "Submit"

3. **Copy your API Key**
   - You'll see a page with your **API Key** (a long string of letters and numbers)
   - Copy this key - you'll need it in the next step

---

## Step 2: Configure LFM

Open your terminal/command prompt and run:

```bash
# Set your API key
lfm config set api-key YOUR_API_KEY_HERE

# Set your Last.fm username
lfm config set username YOUR_LASTFM_USERNAME
```

**Example:**
```bash
lfm config set api-key a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6
lfm config set username musiclover123
```

## Tips & Tricks

### Save Time with Aliases

Add these to your shell config (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or PowerShell profile):

```bash
# Bash/Zsh
alias lfa='lfm artists --limit 10'
alias lft='lfm tracks --period 1month --limit 10'
alias lfr='lfm recent --limit 20'

# PowerShell
Set-Alias lfa 'lfm artists --limit 10'
```

### Performance Tip

LFM uses intelligent caching. The first query might be slow, but subsequent queries are much faster!

If you want to clear the cache:
```bash
lfm cache-clear --all
```

### JSON Output

Most commands support `--json` for programmatic use:

```bash
lfm artists --limit 5 --json
```
