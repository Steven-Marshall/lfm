### Known Issues for Future Sessions

#### üêõ Recommendations Duplicate Track Bug
- **Issue**: Recommendations showing duplicate tracks with slight variations
- **Example**: Wings showing both "Live And Let Die - 2018 Remaster" and "Live and Let Die"
- **Root Cause**: Last.fm API returns multiple versions/remasters as separate tracks
- **Potential Solutions**:
  - Implement track name normalization (remove remaster suffixes, clean punctuation)
  - Add duplicate detection based on similarity scoring
  - Filter tracks by release date preference (original vs remaster)
- **Impact**: Low priority - doesn't break functionality but reduces recommendation quality
- **Location**: Likely in recommendations track fetching logic (RecommendationsCommand.cs)

#### üîç Future Enhancement Opportunities
- **Progress Bars**: As documented in progressbarproject.md for long-running operations
- **Enhanced Track Filtering**: More sophisticated duplicate detection across all commands
- **Device Auto-Discovery**: Automatic detection of new Spotify devices
- **Playlist Export**: JSON/CSV export functionality for query results

### Session: 2025-06-28 (Albums Bug Fix & API Throttling)
- **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Critical bug fixes and comprehensive API throttling
- **Branch**: `refactor/service-layer`

#### ‚úÖ Albums Date Range Bug - FIXED
**Problem**: `albums --year 2023` returned no results despite user having albums
**Root Cause**: `AlbumInfo` model used `[JsonPropertyName("name")]` but Last.fm recent tracks API returns album names as `"#text"`
**Solution**: Changed to `[JsonPropertyName("#text")]` to match API response format
**Testing**: ‚úÖ Verified working for all date ranges

#### ‚úÖ API Throttling Implementation - COMPLETE
**Problem**: Aggressive API calls causing 500 Internal Server Errors from Last.fm
**Root Cause Analysis**:
- **Parallel execution**: Introduced in commit `7958f61` (June 28) for recommendations
- **Missing throttling**: Date range aggregation had no delays between API calls
- **No rate limiting**: Individual and paginated calls lacked throttling

**Solutions Implemented**:

1. **Removed Parallel Execution**:
   - Converted `Task.Run` + `Task.WhenAll` to sequential loops
   - Removed `ConcurrentDictionary`, switched to regular `Dictionary`
   - Applied to recommendations similar artist + track fetching

2. **Added Comprehensive Throttling** (100ms delays):
   - **Date Range Aggregation**: `GetTopAlbumsForDateRangeAsync`, `GetTopTracksForDateRangeAsync`, `GetTopArtistsForDateRangeAsync`
   - **Range Queries**: `ExecuteRangeQueryAsync` for `--range` parameters
   - **Deep Search Operations**: `SearchUserTracksForArtistAsync`, `SearchUserAlbumsForArtistAsync`
   - **Artist Play Count Mapping**: `GetUserArtistPlayCountsAsync`
   - **Recommendations**: Sequential similar artist + track lookups

3. **Preserved One-Shot Calls** (no throttling):
   - `artists --period overall` - single API call
   - `tracks --period overall` - single API call
   - `albums --period overall` - single API call

**Results**:
- ‚úÖ **API Reliability**: Eliminated 500 errors from aggressive requests
- ‚úÖ **Albums Bug Fixed**: Date ranges now return proper album results
- ‚úÖ **Performance**: One-shot calls remain fast, multi-call operations properly throttled
- ‚úÖ **Testing**: All functionality verified working across different scenarios

#### ‚úÖ Error Caching Analysis - VERIFIED SAFE
**Investigation**: Checked if 500 errors were being cached
**Finding**: `if (apiResult != null)` in cache - we **only cache successful results** ‚úÖ
**Status**: No caching issues, 500 errors correctly not cached

#### ‚úÖ Configuration Integration
- **Throttle Setting**: `ApiThrottleMs = 100` (configurable via `config set-throttle`)
- **DI Integration**: Throttle value passed from config to `LastFmApiClient` constructor
- **Applied Consistently**: All multi-call operations use configured throttle value

**Build Status**: ‚úÖ Clean build, 0 warnings, 0 errors
**Architecture Status**: Comprehensive API throttling implemented, albums bug resolved

#### ‚úÖ Previous Phase 1 & 2 Refactoring (COMPLETED)
**Service Layer**: ‚úÖ Full `ILastFmService` with 13 core methods extracted
**Display Logic**: ‚úÖ Centralized via enhanced `IDisplayService`
**Command Simplification**: ‚úÖ Commands reduced to pure CLI concerns
**Business Logic**: ‚úÖ 370+ lines moved from commands to service layer
**Error Handling**: ‚úÖ Result<T> pattern and ErrorResult classification implemented

### Session: 2025-09-24 (TopTracks Command & Architectural Separation)

### Session: 2025-10-06 (Album Track Checking & API Performance Analysis)
- **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Album checking with track-level breakdown and comprehensive API timing diagnostics
- **Major Features Implemented**:
  - **Album Check Command**: Check album play counts with detailed per-track breakdown
  - **Apostrophe Variant Handling**: Automatic retry with Unicode variants (U+0027, U+2018, U+2019) for track/album lookups
  - **Discrepancy Detection**: Intelligent detection and reporting of unaccounted plays due to name mismatches
  - **API Performance Diagnostics**: Detailed timing breakdown (throttle, HTTP, JSON-read, JSON-parse, cache)
  - **Throttle Optimization**: Changed default from 100ms to 200ms for Last.fm's 5 req/sec limit
- **Key Technical Components**:
  - `CheckCommand.cs`: Album checking with `--album` parameter and `--verbose` for track breakdown
  - `GetTrackPlaycountWithApostropheRetry`: Handles Unicode apostrophe variants in track names
  - Discrepancy calculation: `albumTotal - sumOfTracks` with user-friendly messaging
  - `LastFmApiClient`: Added `LastHttpMs`, `LastJsonReadMs`, `LastJsonParseMs` timing properties
  - `CachedLastFmApiClient`: Enhanced timing breakdown for all cache behaviors
- **Album Check Features**:
  - Console output: Track-by-track breakdown with play counts, percentages, most-played indicator
  - JSON output: Full data including `unaccountedPlays`, `hasDiscrepancy` fields
  - Listening pattern analysis: "Heavy rotation" vs "Balanced listening"
  - Discrepancy notes: Helpful explanation about featuring artists, remixes, remastered versions
- **Apostrophe Handling**:
  - Problem: Album API returns U+0027 (`'`), but scrobbles may have U+2018 (`'`) or U+2019 (`'`)
  - Solution: Try original name, then left quote variant, then right quote variant
  - Example: "Wish You Were Here" vs "Wish You Were Here" vs "Wish You Were Here"
  - Applied to: Track lookups, album lookups, individual track checks
- **Discrepancy Detection**:
  - Classic example: "exile" (album API) vs "exile (feat. Bon Iver)" (scrobbles)
  - Shows: "40 plays unaccounted for" instead of misleading "0 plays"
  - Pink Floyd example: "Shine On You Crazy Diamond" vs "Shine On You Crazy Diamond (Parts 1-5)"
  - Provides factual information without expensive fuzzy matching (would require 200+ API calls)
- **API Performance Investigation**:
  - **Finding**: HTTP/Last.fm backend is the bottleneck (90-95% of time)
  - **Timing breakdown** for single API call:
    - HTTP network transfer: 400-4000ms (highly variable, Last.fm server performance)
    - JSON parsing: 17-32ms (consistently fast, <2% of total time)
    - JSON stream reading: 0-1ms (negligible)
    - Cache writing: 20-50ms (~3% of total time)
    - Throttle: 0-200ms (depends on spacing between calls)
  - **Comparison across query types** (limit=10):
    - Tracks: ~850ms HTTP
    - Albums: ~400-3900ms HTTP (highly variable!)
    - Artists: ~390ms HTTP
  - **Conclusion**: Data volume/JSON processing is NOT the issue - it's Last.fm's server response time
- **MCP Integration**:
  - Updated `lfm-guidelines.md` with discrepancy interpretation guidance
  - Added examples of unaccounted plays and how to interpret them
  - Guidance for LLMs: Don't assume 0-play tracks are disliked if album has high playcount
  - Real-world example: Taylor Swift "folklore" with "exile (feat. Bon Iver)" mismatch
- **Configuration Changes**:
  - `LfmConfig.cs`: `ApiThrottleMs` default changed from 100ms to 200ms
  - Safer compliance with Last.fm's documented 5 req/sec rate limit
- **Example Use Case** (Pink Floyd "Wish You Were Here"):
  - Album: 56 plays total
  - Track breakdown: 40 plays accounted (WYWH title track: 23, others: 17)
  - Unaccounted: 16 plays (likely "Shine On You Crazy Diamond" with different part naming)
  - **Inference**: ~8 full album listens + ~12 extra title track plays
  - Demonstrates value of discrepancy approach for understanding listening patterns
- **Build Status**: ‚úÖ Clean build, 0 errors, comprehensive timing diagnostics available
- **Ready For**: User testing of album check features and MCP integration

### Session: 2025-10-09 (Spotify Album Disambiguation & Parallel API Calls)

  - `ArtistSearchCommand.cs`: Parallel batch processing using `Task.WhenAll` with rate limiting
  - `CachedLastFmApiClient.cs`: `DisableThrottling` property for parallel batch mode
  - `LfmConfig.cs`: New `ParallelApiCalls` setting (default: 5 concurrent calls)
  - `CheckCommand.cs`: Enhanced JSON output with interpretation guidance
- **Album Version Disambiguation**:
  - **Problem**: Tracks like "Live and Let Die" exist on studio albums, greatest hits, live albums
  - **Solution**: Detect multiple versions, return error listing all album options
  - **User preference**: Studio albums preferred over live/greatest hits unless explicitly requested
  - **MCP integration**: LLM can specify album parameter when multiple versions detected
  - **Example**: "Hey Jude" appears on "Hey Jude", "1967-1970", "Past Masters" - user chooses which
- **Parallel API Calls**:
  - **Use case**: Deep searches (artist-tracks, artist-albums) that page through 1000+ pages
  - **Implementation**: Batch of 5 API calls executed concurrently using `Task.WhenAll`
  - **Rate limiting**: 1 second between batches to respect Last.fm's 5 req/sec limit
  - **Throttling**: Individual call throttling disabled during parallel execution
  - **Batch timing**: Dynamic delay calculation ensures compliance with rate limits
  - **Performance**: Significant speedup for deep searches without violating API limits
- **MCP Guidelines Refactoring** (see separate commit):
  - Replaced quiz/password system with trust-based `lfm_init`
  - Guidelines reduced from 308 to 176 lines
  - Added user preferences section and response style guidance
  - Proven effective through Claudette testing (Pink Floyd, Taylor Swift examples)
- **Configuration**:
  - `ParallelApiCalls`: Number of concurrent API calls in batch mode (default: 5)
  - Compatible with existing cache and throttle settings
- **Build Status**: ‚úÖ Clean build, all features tested and working

- ‚úÖ Status indicators: ‚úÖ‚ùå vs [OK][X]
- ‚úÖ Cache status: üìäüìàüßπ vs [CONFIG][STATS][CLEANUP]

### ‚úÖ Unicode Auto-Detection Issue (RESOLVED)

**Problem**: Config set to "Auto" was initially failing in PowerShell 5/7.

**Root Cause**: Console encoding defaulting to Codepage 850 instead of UTF-8.

**Solution Implemented**: 
- **EnsureUtf8Encoding()** method in SymbolProvider automatically sets UTF-8 encoding when Unicode is detected
- **Graceful fallback** to ASCII if UTF-8 encoding fails
- **Environment-agnostic detection** using WT_SESSION and fallback methods

**Comprehensive Testing Results** (Session 2025-01-18):

| Environment | Config=Auto | Config=Enabled | Unicode Symbols | Console Encoding |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **PowerShell 5** | ‚úÖ Perfect | ‚úÖ Perfect | ‚ô´ ‚úÖ ‚ùå ‚è±Ô∏è üìã | UTF-8 (CP: 65001) |
| **PowerShell 7** | ‚úÖ Perfect | ‚úÖ Perfect | ‚ô´ ‚úÖ ‚ùå ‚è±Ô∏è üìã | UTF-8 (CP: 65001) |
| **WSL** | ‚úÖ Perfect | ‚úÖ Perfect | ‚ô´ ‚úÖ ‚ùå ‚è±Ô∏è üìã | UTF-8 (CP: 65001) |
| **CMD** | ‚úÖ Perfect | ‚úÖ Perfect | ‚ô´ ‚úÖ ‚ùå ‚è±Ô∏è üìã | UTF-8 (CP: 65001) |

**Key Technical Insights:**
- `PSEdition` environment variable is not propagated to child processes (expected behavior)
- `WT_SESSION` detection works reliably across all Windows Terminal environments
- Automatic UTF-8 encoding setting resolves all console encoding issues
- Detection logic works correctly across all tested environments

**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETELY RESOLVED** - Unicode auto-detection working perfectly across all environments

## Debugging Lessons Learned

### üéØ Critical Thinking Over Quick Fixes

**Lesson from 2010 Cache Bug** (Session: 2025-09-30)

As an AI coding assistant, there's a tendency to "make it work" rather than "understand why it's broken." This can lead to premature workarounds instead of proper diagnosis.

**The Bug Pattern:**
- `lfm artists --year 2010` returned empty results ‚ùå
- `lfm tracks --year 2010` worked perfectly ‚úÖ
- Other years (2009, 2011) worked fine ‚úÖ

**Initial Mistake:** Suspected Last.fm API limitations and considered implementing automatic chunking workarounds.

**What Should Have Been Obvious:**
- Both commands use the same underlying `GetRecentTracksAsync` API method
- If the API worked for tracks, it should work for artists
- Inconsistent behavior between similar operations strongly suggests **our code**, not the API

**The Real Cause:** Empty responses were being cached due to insufficient validation in `CachedLastFmApiClient.cs`:
```csharp
// WRONG: Caches empty objects
if (apiResult != null) {
    await CacheAsync(apiResult);
}

// RIGHT: Validate data exists before caching
if (apiResult != null && HasData(apiResult)) {
    await CacheAsync(apiResult);
}
```

**Key Principle:**

> **If the bug pattern defies logic for external factors, it's almost certainly our own code. Dig there first.** üéØ

**Debugging Checklist:**
1. ‚úÖ Do similar operations behave differently? ‚Üí Suspect our code
2. ‚úÖ Does forcing fresh data (`--force-api`) work? ‚Üí Cache/state issue
3. ‚úÖ Are symptoms logically inconsistent with external API behavior? ‚Üí Our bug
4. ‚úÖ Before implementing workarounds, validate the problem is external
5. ‚úÖ Be skeptical and critical, especially when symptoms don't make sense

**Never:**
